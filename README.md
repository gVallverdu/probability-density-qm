# Probability density in Quantum Chemistry

Live demo: https://probability-density-qm.herokuapp.com/

This is a [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) application that aims to
illustrate the link between the wavefunction and the probability density
in quantum chemistry.

As a first example, the app provides the results of the Schr√∂dinger 
equation associated to the particle in a box system.
